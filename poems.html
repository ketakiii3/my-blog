      <h2>my belief</h2>
      <pre>
To my philosophical belief that merges with my spiritual one - where boundaries blur, where questions swarm like prayers beneath the fluorescent lights.
What’s spirituality? Trust, faith, belief suspended in the ether of human longing. What’s philosophy? The study of belief dissected under reason’s careful knife.
I was in 9th grade writing an essay for “Spirituality vs Religion” - I was a kid & if I didn’t know any better, I would’ve said they’re the same things. But they’re not & my first prize for that essay told me the same (I’m very modest, I promise).

The topic itself was wrong actually, because you cannot debate on two things that intersect with core functionalities. Belief, faith, whatever you call it, the center of them all. In short, in my opinion of course,
Spirituality is the course of action through which we set our beliefs & Religion gives us a box to put our beliefs into. Easy, right? But the reality is complex & I'm not a philosopher so I won’t get into it.

If you’ve read this far, let me share the core of my belief. Born to two doctors, I’ve witnessed firsthand that the loudest prayers echo through hospital corridors. When pulled from darkness, patients often elevate physicians to divine status, and perhaps rightfully so.
I once dreamt of studying medicine before recognizing I lacked the fortitude for its burdens. Instead, I found my path elsewhere. As the Bhagavad Gita teaches: “You have the right only to work; never be impelled by the fruits of your work.”

I chose computer science after a practical Google search for “Highest paying jobs in 2021” (go ahead, laugh). Through four years of diligent work, when finally applying for my master’s program, I surrendered to Krishna. “I’ve done my part. Now, the rest is yours.” And the sweet fruit was given.

Well, I’m still human, still burning with wants that flicker like candlelight under my open-flame existence. Yet I’m willing to try the art of surrender, for faith glows orange even under the blue lights of doubt.

Belief works in cycles of surrender and reward, while doubt spirals in endless questioning. Between these two, I've found my home by letting both logic and mystery guide my uncertain steps forward.

    <section id="paradox">
      <h2>the paradox i carry</h2>
      <pre>
the universe cursed me too, 
in that moment when endings felt final,
standing at the edge of my own ceaseless night,
wondering if light would ever remember the way back.

but it blessed me too,
for how else do you learn to be the universe’s contradiction, 
its favorite mistake, its beloved burden, 
dancing between grace and punishment like the flower i’m named after?

Ketaki - a flower that blooms at night, 
with a fragrance so intoxicating it travels for miles, 
drawing moths and dreamers to her white petals that spiral, 
making peacocks dance in gardens that are 
drunk on her presence’s arrival - 
such stories, i was told of a name that carries the 
weight of ancient lies and the indication of vindication.

a sacred bloom that stood beside Brahma 
when he claimed to have touched the infinite inception, 
her petals trembling with the weight of his deception.

for this, she was cursed, never to grace the temples of Shiva, 
her divine fragrance deemed unworthy of 
the god who dances on the cosmos.

but, every Maha Shivratri, 
forgiveness blooms in the darkness between prayers, 
and she returns to where she belongs.
in holy places, where her essence is finally blessed, and not cursed.

this is what I carry in my name.
the contradiction of beauty and betrayal, 
the realization that witnesses can become accomplices, 
that suffering and devotion share the same rhythm.

i am Ketaki, 
blooming in my own dusk, 
fragrant with complexity, 
cursed and blessed, 
the universe’s dancing and defiant daughter, 
who is forever learning that the scent of survival 
is more powerful than the sweetest perfume.
